## 🤖 What's New: AI-Powered Smart Metadata!

ReCd just got a whole lot smarter! When you make a CD public, we use **Google Gemini 2.0 Flash** to automatically analyze your files and generate intelligent metadata:

- **🔍 Smart Search**: Find CDs by content, not just names
- **🏷️ Auto-Tagging**: AI generates relevant tags from filenames
- **🎯 Better Discovery**: Public CDs are easier to find in the marketplace
- **🔒 Privacy-First**: Only happens when YOU make a CD public
- **⚡ Non-Blocking**: Happens in the background—no waiting
- **🎨 Retro UI**: Metadata displayed in authentic Y2K style

**How it works:**
1. Upload files with descriptive names (e.g., "sunset_beach_vacation.jpg")
2. Toggle CD to public
3. AI analyzes filenames and generates smart tags
4. Metadata appears in retro Y2K style
5. Enhanced search makes your CD discoverable

**Pro tip**: Use descriptive filenames for best AI results!

See [AI_METADATA_FEATURE.md](docs/AI_METADATA_FEATURE.md) for technical details.

## 🎯 About The Project

Remember the days when you'd carefully select songs, burn them onto a CD, design custom cover art, and share your creation with friends? **ReCd(fyi)** brings back that nostalgic experience in a modern, digital format.

In an era where music and media have become infinitely accessible yet somehow less personal, ReCd(fyi) recreates the intimate act of curating and sharing media collections. Each virtual CD is limited to 20MB—just like the real thing—forcing thoughtful curation and making each share feel special.

### 🎨 The Y2K Aesthetic

ReCd(fyi) embraces the visual language of early 2000s CD burning software with:
- Retro Windows 98/XP-inspired UI elements
- 3D button effects and beveled borders
- Spinning disc animations and burning progress bars
- Nostalgic color palettes (cyan, purple, silver)
- Classic system fonts and pixel-perfect layouts

### ✨ Key Features

#### Core Experience
- **� V0irtual CD Burning**: Upload media files with authentic burning animations that'll take you right back to 2003
- **� 20MB SLimit**: Just like real CDs—forces you to actually think about what matters
- **🎨 Y2K Aesthetic**: Spinning CDs, 3D buttons, gradient backgrounds, and that sweet Windows XP vibe

#### Sharing & Discovery
- **�  Easy Sharing**: Share via email or copy a link—no complicated steps
- **🎭 Guest Access**: Your friends don't need to sign up to view your CDs (but we'll gently encourage them)
- **⏰ 30-Day Links**: Shared links expire after a month, keeping things fresh
- **� Putblic Marketplace**: Browse CDs from other creators and discover new music
- **�  Creator Profiles**: Build your collection and show off your taste

#### User Experience
- **🎵 Media Preview**: Play audio, watch videos, view images—all built-in
- **📦 ZIP Downloads**: Grab entire CDs in one click
- **🔒 Privacy Controls**: Keep CDs private or share them with the world
- **📱 Fully Responsive**: Works great on your phone, tablet, or desktop
- **♿ Accessible**: Keyboard navigation, screen reader support, reduced motion options

#### New Features (Latest Update)
- **🏠 Landing Page**: Beautiful intro page that explains what ReCd is all about
- **📄 Info Pages**: Complete About, Help, Privacy, and Terms pages
- **💬 Guest Prompt**: First-time visitors get a friendly welcome with option to sign up or continue as guest
- **🎯 Better Sharing**: Fixed share link routing and improved guest access flow

## 🚀 Getting Started

Want to run ReCd locally? Here's how to get it up and running in about 10 minutes.

### Prerequisites

You'll need these installed on your machine:

- **Node.js** 18.x or higher (check with `node --version`)
- **npm** 9.x or higher (comes with Node)
- **Firebase CLI** - Install it globally: `npm install -g firebase-tools`
- **Firebase Project** - Create one at [console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com) (it's free!)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/recd-platform.git
   cd recd-platform
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   ```
   
   > **Note**: Use `--legacy-peer-deps` due to React 19 being newer than some peer dependencies expect.

3. **Set up Firebase**
   
   In your Firebase console, enable these services:
   - **Authentication** → Email/Password provider
   - **Firestore Database** → Start in test mode (we'll deploy rules later)
   - **Cloud Storage** → Start in test mode

4. **Configure environment variables**
   
   Copy the example file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```
   
   Then grab your Firebase config from Project Settings → General → Your apps → Web app.
   
   Edit `.env.local` with your actual values:
   ```env
   # Firebase Configuration (get these from Firebase console)
   VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=AIzaSyXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
   VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project.firebaseapp.com
   VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
   VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project.firebasestorage.app
   VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=123456789012
   VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:123456789012:web:abcdef123456

   # EmailJS Configuration (optional - for email sharing feature)
   # Sign up at https://www.emailjs.com/ - it's free for 200 emails/month
   VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=service_xxx
   VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=template_xxx
   VITE_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key
   
   # Google Gemini AI (optional - for smart metadata generation)
   # Get your API key from https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
   # Free tier: 15 requests/min, 1500/day - plenty for most use cases
   VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
   ```
   
   > **Note**: EmailJS and Gemini API are optional. Without them, email sharing and AI metadata won't work, but everything else will.

5. **Deploy Firebase security rules**
   ```bash
   firebase login
   firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,storage:rules
   ```

6. **Start the app**
   
   You'll need two terminal windows:
   
   **Terminal 1** - Firebase Emulators (local database):
   ```bash
   firebase emulators:start
   ```
   
   **Terminal 2** - Development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

7. **Open your browser and start burning CDs!**
   - **App**: http://localhost:5173
   - **Firebase Emulator UI**: http://localhost:4000 (to peek at the database)
   
   The app will hot-reload as you make changes. Pretty neat!

## 🧪 Testing

I am testing seriously here. ReCd has **80%+ code coverage** with multiple types of tests.

### What's Tested

I have got tests for pretty much everything:
- ✅ **Authentication** - Sign up, login, password reset
- ✅ **CD Management** - Create, edit, delete, share
- ✅ **File Operations** - Upload, download, preview, validation
- ✅ **Sharing** - Token generation, guest access, expiration
- ✅ **Marketplace** - Public CDs, search, filtering
- ✅ **User Profiles** - Username changes, public collections
- ✅ **Security Rules** - Who can access what
- ✅ **Error Handling** - What happens when things go wrong
- ✅ **Responsive Design** - Mobile, tablet, desktop

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests (quick)
npm test

# Watch mode (runs tests as you code)
npm run test:watch

# Full coverage report (see what's not tested)
npm run test:coverage

# Just the security rules
npm run test:security
```


## 📊 Architecture

### Serverless Architecture

ReCd(fyi) uses a fully serverless architecture leveraging Firebase services:

```
┌─────────────┐
│   Vercel    │  ← Frontend hosting
│  (React)    │
└──────┬──────┘
       │
       ├─────────────────────────────────────┐
       │                                     │
       ▼                                     ▼
┌─────────────┐                      ┌─────────────┐

└──────┬──────┘                      └─────────────┘
       │
       ├──────────────┬──────────────┐

│Firestore │   │ Storage  │   │  Rules   │
│ Database │   │  Bucket  │   │  Engine  │
└──────────┘   └──────────┘   └──────────┘
```

### Data Models

#### Firestore Collections

```typescript
// users/{userId}
{
  email: string;
  username: string;
  createdAt: Timestamp;
  publicCDCount: number;
}

// cds/{cdId}
{
  name: string;
  userId: string;
  createdAt: Timestamp;
  fileCount: number;
  totalSize: number;
  isPublic: boolean;
  publicAt?: Timestamp;
  viewCount: number;
}

// cds/{cdId}/files/{fileId}
{
  name: string;
  type: string;
  size: number;
  storagePath: string;
  uploadedAt: Timestamp;
}

// shareTokens/{tokenId}
{
  cdId: string;
  userId: string;
  expiresAt: Timestamp;
  createdAt: Timestamp;
}

// emailLogs/{logId}
{
  to: string;
  subject: string;
  status: 'sent' | 'failed';
  sentAt: Timestamp;
}
```

#### Storage Structure

```
users/{userId}/cds/{cdId}/files/{fileId}.{ext}
users/{userId}/cds/{cdId}/thumbnails/{fileId}_thumb.jpg
```

### Security Model

Security is enforced at the database level using Firebase Security Rules:

- ✅ Users can only access their own CDs
- ✅ Public CDs are readable by anyone
- ✅ Share tokens grant temporary access
- ✅ File uploads are validated (type, size)
- ✅ Rate limiting on sensitive operations

Security isn't just a feature—it's baked into every layer.

### Authentication
- **Firebase Auth** handles all the heavy lifting
- Passwords are hashed and never stored in plain text
- Sessions expire automatically for safety
- Password reset via email (no security questions from 2003)

### Access Control
- **Firestore Security Rules** enforce who can see what at the database level
- Private CDs are locked down—only you can access them
- Public CDs are readable by anyone (that's the point)
- Share tokens grant temporary guest access (30 days max)
- Even if someone guesses a CD ID, they can't access it without permission

### File Safety
- **Strict file type validation**: Only images, audio, video allowed
- **Size limits**: 20MB per CD total, reasonable limits per file
- **Storage Rules** double-check everything before accepting uploads
- Malicious files get rejected before they touch our servers

### Privacy Promise
- Your data is yours—we never sell or share it
- Private CDs stay private unless you explicitly share them
- Guest access is read-only (they can view, not modify)
- Email addresses are only used for auth and sharing (no spam)
- You can delete your account and all data anytime

### What We Track
- **Analytics**: View counts on public CDs (helps creators)
- **Share tokens**: Who accessed what and when (for debugging)
- **Email logs**: Success/failure of share emails (troubleshooting)
- **That's it**: No tracking pixels, no third-party analytics, no creepy stuff

## 🌐 Deployment

Ready to ship it to production? Here's how.

### Quick Deploy (Vercel + Firebase)

**Step 1: Deploy the Frontend**

1. Push your code to GitHub (or GitLab, Bitbucket)

2. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and import your repo

3. Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard:
   ```
   VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY
   VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN
   VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
   VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET
   VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
   VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID
   VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID (optional)
   VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID (optional)
   VITE_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY (optional)
   ```

4. Click Deploy—Vercel handles the rest

**Step 2: Deploy Firebase Rules**

Your database needs security rules in production:

```bash
# Make sure you're logged in
firebase login

# Deploy the security rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,storage:rules

# If you have custom indexes
firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes
```

**Step 3: Update Firebase Auth Domain**

In Firebase Console → Authentication → Settings → Authorized domains:
- Add your Vercel domain (e.g., `your-app.vercel.app`)
- Add your custom domain if you have one

### Manual Deploy (if you prefer)

```bash
# Build the app
npm run build

# Deploy to Vercel
vercel --prod

# Or deploy to any static host
# The build output is in the 'dist' folder
```

### Post-Deploy Checklist

- [ ] Test authentication (sign up, login, logout)
- [ ] Create a test CD and upload files
- [ ] Share a CD and test the guest access
- [ ] Check the marketplace
- [ ] Test on mobile device
- [ ] Verify email sharing works (if configured)

### Troubleshooting

**"Permission denied" errors?**
- Make sure you deployed the Firestore rules
- Check that your domain is authorized in Firebase

**Emails not sending?**
- Verify EmailJS credentials are correct
- Check EmailJS dashboard for quota/errors

**Build failing?**
- Run `npm run build` locally first
- Check for TypeScript errors with `npm run build:check`
